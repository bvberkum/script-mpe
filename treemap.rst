Treemap
=======

The following diagram shows a filetree which squares build from all the files, using colors for different directories.
It required an XML like structure, and the script was borrowed from http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063582.

There is no interaction.

        <iframe src="treemap/1.html" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

Another treemap-like diagram shows another representation of the filetree in JSON as a navigable, top-down tree structure.
It does seem to render something, but the JSONs are different:
`JSON </project-treemap.json>`_
