This is not a conflict marker, but maybe a title underline.

Title
=======
It is counted as conflict by the 'count' sub-command.

Other occurences of the start and end markers, <<<<<<< and >>>>>>>, should
have none or minimal effect. Unless ofcourse old merge-conflicts are committed,
and nested. But that mess is beyond the scope of this gist. The following stray
markers also cause count to react, but not the diff/stat routines.
