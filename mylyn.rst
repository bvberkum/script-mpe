Mylyn is a library for wikitext conversions to/from HTML and several other
formats, used with Eclipse, Ant and other.

It provides a bridge between HTML and the following wiki markup variants:

- Textile
- MediaWiki
- TracWiki
- TWiki
- Confluence
- any extension from the wild on org.eclipse.mylyn.wikitext.core.parser.markup.MarkupLanguage

and also docbook, Eclipse help, OASIS DITA and Apache XSL-FO.

None of these are unfortenately are very structured markups. But do provide
necessary packing in the case of online help.
There are several Textile links on the `Mylyn WikiText User Guide`__, but little
to none on the rest.
