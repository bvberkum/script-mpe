lib
    - Adding namespace declarations to command classes. 
      Registered through lib.namespaces.
    - Trying first support for unicode file names. Need more generic handling,
      and tests.

libcmd
    - Adding new class vars, rewrote Cmd.main

main
    - Rewrote Main to use AbstractTargetResolver and Resourcer base
      instead of Taxus.

res
    - new class Volume, Workspace.. to replace taxus.Volume? 
    - Extended res.File ignore pattern mechanism to ignored names and paths,
      same for res.Dir.
