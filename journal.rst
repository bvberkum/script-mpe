Journal
=======
A journal is a logbook of entries for either specific day, week, month or years.

Normally the collection is a single ordered list of entries per date.
Ie. file bounds are day boundaries.
Levels at other period lengths add parallel ordered sequences.

Sequences can be sparse and not every period needs to have an entry.

With parallel period orders, the different ranks not only align but also
an overlap in content could be implied; except additional (user) structure will
probably differentiate. Ie. some note in 2018 can concern 2018-01-01, iow.
entry 2018-01-01 includes anything from larger periods. Except if doc segments
are marked as they likely are to concern a specific sub-period, e.g. 2018-01
would summarize notable events.

- day
- week
- month
- year

Other periods like decade, quarter or semester don't seem useful atm
