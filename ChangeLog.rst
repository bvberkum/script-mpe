Change Log
----------
2008
    Seperate project created for all scripts on my $PATH,
    previously in my private dotfile repository.
2012
    Have had various mostly imcomplete projects involving
    Python command-line tools. Focus moves to this project
    to build sharable code for the problems of interest,
    most specifically file and resource metadata management.
2013
    Various scripts are still unused in daily sysops.
    Moved to create a single frontend which is too ambitious while other
    shared code is still immature.

    Started using testing and looking at Zope Component Architecture to improve
    program stability during project development.
2014
    Planning to continue to improve confparse and libcmd, split those off,
    see how that works for other projects.

2015
    Now using htd, vc, dckr and other scripts only mostly.
    Stopped dev on most python scripts, but for now and then.
